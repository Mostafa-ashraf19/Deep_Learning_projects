#	Classifying Clothes 

in this project make build and train neural network by `Fashion-MNIST` dataset it's consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes, we used it in `pytorch`.

Here's an example how the data looks (each class takes three-rows):
